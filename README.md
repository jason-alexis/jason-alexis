🌱 What I'm Learning & Building
I'm continuously working on projects to apply and expand my data skills. Here's a look at what I'm currently focused on:

Crunchyroll Actors/Directors Analysis 🎬📈
Project Goal: To identify which voice actors and directors are most strongly associated with high-rated, popular anime titles, helping Crunchyroll prioritize proven talent for content acquisition.

Background: Anime's global fanbase is surging, creating immense pressure on Crunchyroll's licensing team to efficiently acquire top-performing titles. Currently, there's limited analysis on how voice actors and directors impact a title's success (measured by IMDb ratings and vote counts). This project aims to fill that gap by surfacing top contributors, enabling data-informed licensing strategies that can improve content ROI by an estimated 5–15%.

Technologies: [Expected technologies like Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn), SQL, potentially Tableau for visualization if applicable]

Status: Work in Progress 🚧 (Link to repository coming soon!)
